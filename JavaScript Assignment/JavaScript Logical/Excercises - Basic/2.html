    <!-- The notes showed a simple version of max that took exactly two arguments. Update this to take exactly three arguments. Note that the builtin version of Math.max takes any number of arguments, which is much better. but we don't know how to do variable arguments yet. And, of course, no using Math.max on this exercise. -->
