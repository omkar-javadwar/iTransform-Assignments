    <!-- Write a function that takes a list of numbers, a starting base b1 and a target base b2 and interprets the list
        as a number in base b1 and converts it into a number in base b2 (in the form of a list-of-digits). So for
        example [2,1,0] in base 3 gets converted to base 10 as [2,1]. -->
