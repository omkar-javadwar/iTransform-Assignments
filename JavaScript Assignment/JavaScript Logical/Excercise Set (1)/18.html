    <!-- Write a function on all that applies a function to every element of a list. Use it to print the first twenty
        perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few
        perfect squares are 1'1 1, 22-4, 33-9, 4*4=16. Twelve for example is not a perfect square because there is no
        natural number m so that m*m=12. (This question is tricky if your programming language makes it difficult to
        pass functions as arguments.) -->
