    <!-- Enter this function into the console:
        function half(x) {return (x / 2);} 
    Try to predict what you will get for half(x), half(4), and half(3). It is simple to predict what you will get for half(4), but, depending on your programming background, it might not be so easy to predict what you will get for half(x) and half(3). Call half(x), half(4), and half(3) and see if you were right. -->

        function half(x) {
            return x / 2;
        }
        console.log(half(x));
        console.log(half(4));
