    <!--Make a function called calculation that, given three numbers a, b, and c, returns (a + b)/c. Try it with a few normal
    values. Then, try to predict what you will get for calculation(1, 1, 0), calculation(-1,-1, 0), and calculation(1,-1,
    0). Try those tests and see if you get what you expected. -->

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function calculation(a, b, c) {
            return (a + b) / c;
        }
        console.log(calculation(1, 1, 0)); //Infinity
        console.log(calculation(-1, -1, 0)); //-Infinity
        console.log(calculation(1, -1, 0)); //NaN
