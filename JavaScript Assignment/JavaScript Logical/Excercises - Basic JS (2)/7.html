    <!-- Try the "more powerful practice" approach from the notes, where you load an HTML file that has a script tag pointing at a JavaScript file. Put a function definition in the JS file, load the HTML file, go to the console, and call the function. Then, add a second function definition to the JS file, reload the HTML file, return to the console, and call the new function. -->
