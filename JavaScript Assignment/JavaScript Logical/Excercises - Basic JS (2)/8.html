    <!-- Write a function called isEven that, given a number, returns true if the number is even and false if the number is odd. This would be simple if we had covered if statements or the ?: ternary operator. but we haven't, so you cannot use either one. -->

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function isEven(num){
            return [true, false][num % 2];
        }
        console.log(isEven(2)); //true
        console.log(isEven(3)); //false
